## üåê Project Overview

This Cisco Packet Tracer project simulates a **Smart Office Network** where **Home IoT devices** securely connect to **Office infrastructure** via VLAN segmentation and Inter-VLAN Routing.

> üîí Communication between networks is strictly controlled using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.

---

## üß© Key Components

- üîå **2 Computers** connected via Switch for basic connectivity test
- üåê **Web Server** hosting a landing page
- üìß **Email Server** for internal mail simulation
- üìÅ **FTP Server** for file exchange
- üß† **IoT Sensors** and an **IoT Server**
- üè† **Home Devices** (like Smart Thermostat) securely communicating with office devices
- üì¶ **VLANs** to isolate Home, Office, IoT zones
- üì° **Router-on-a-Stick** setup for inter-VLAN routing
- üîê **ACLs** to restrict unauthorized access

## üß† How Home & Office Devices Communicate

> ‚ùì**Why are Home Devices talking to Office Devices?**

Although VLANs isolate traffic, **Inter-VLAN Routing** is enabled to allow **selective, secured communication**, such as:

| From             | To                  | Status        | Reason                                           |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Office PC        | Home IoT Device     | ‚úÖ Allowed     | For monitoring IoT sensors                       |
| Home Laptop      | Office Web Server   | ‚ùå Blocked     | Enforced via ACLs                                |
| Office PC        | FTP/Email Server    | ‚úÖ Allowed     | Internal usage for services                      |
| IoT Sensor       | IoT Server          | ‚úÖ Allowed     | Sensor ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Server flow                      |
| Home Devices     | Office PC           | ‚ùå Blocked     | Maintains segmentation and privacy               |

üîê ACLs are implemented to ensure **only authorized** traffic flows between VLANs. Think of it as a **custom firewall** inside the router.

| üìÅ FTP Transfers       | Securely download/upload files inside office VLAN                           |
| üì° IoT Sensor Traffic  | Simulate sensor readings to a central IoT Server                            |
| üîê ACLs                | Ensure role-based and zone-based access control                             |
| üßë‚Äçüíª CLI Skills         | Practice `show ip route`, `ipconfig`, `show interfaces`, `tracert` and more |

## üßµ Commands You Can Try

```bash
# On Router
show ip route
show ip interface brief
show access-lists

# On PC
ipconfig /all
ping 192.168.x.x
tracert web.local

## üìÇ Project Insights

* üèóÔ∏è VLAN Design:

  * VLAN 10 ‚Äì Office
  * VLAN 20 ‚Äì IoT
  * VLAN 30 ‚Äì Home
* üéõÔ∏è Inter-VLAN Routing: Router-on-a-stick (Sub-interfaces on Fa0/0.10, Fa0/0.20, etc.)
* üîë DHCP used in each VLAN

## üí° Tip for Presenting

> *‚ÄúWe designed this Cisco PT network to reflect real-world segmentation using VLANs. We allowed controlled access between home and office zones via inter-VLAN routing, and protected each zone using ACLs. The result is a flexible, secure smart network simulation.‚Äù*
